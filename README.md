# homebrew-warp-legacy

üç∫ **Legacy versions of Warp terminal for Homebrew** - Providing access to stable older versions for users experiencing issues with recent releases.

## Purpose

Warp's frequent updates bring exciting new features and improvements, but sometimes introduce regressions that affect daily workflows. For example, recent versions have experienced IME input issues that prevent proper input of non-Latin languages like Japanese, Chinese, and Korean ([#6891](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/6891), [#6886](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/6886)).

This tap provides stable, older versions of Warp as a fallback. Use it when a recent update breaks your workflow or you need consistent behavior for critical projects. It serves as a temporary solution while waiting for official fixes.

For the latest features, always prefer the official version: `brew install --cask warp`.  
You can also visit the [Warp website](https://www.warp.dev/) for more information.
